### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Milad

- I'm a computer scientist / mathematician who turned out to be a python developer.
- :snake: My python areas of interests range from building simple ***web apps*** to applying ***machine learning*** and ***deep learning*** to predict financial markets. 
- :signal_strength: I'm an expert in scraping data, data manipulation and building data pipelines. Of course all of this means nothing unless you can utilize all that data through machine learning algorithms and build a better future.
- My recent work involved in building and maintaining Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems like Google CCAI using the Advanced Agent Modeling (AAM) process.
- Core developer and contributor of dfcx-scrapi: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dfcx-scrapi/) / [github](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dfcx-scrapi)
